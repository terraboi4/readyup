Game modes
Hot potato - virtual hot potato passed around. Answer the question correctly before time runs out or you are eliminated. Goes to last one standing in circle
Buzzin Bracket - players matched up in a bracket style tournament. The games each have 5 questions and whoever answers the most out of 5 correctly and quickest advances. Play to final round.  
Scavenger hunt - Players have to answer questions correctly to unlock helpful clues as to where a treasure chest might be hidden around the map. First person to find the treasure wins. There can also be misleading clues that might lead people the wrong way if they get the question wrong. Also if you get the answer right or wrong it won’t tell you so you don’t know if the clue is helpful or hurtful.
